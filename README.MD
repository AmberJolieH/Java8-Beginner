## Hello World

### Print Line 
    ```Java
    System.out.println("Hello, world");
    //Output: Hello, world!
    ```
System.out.println() can print to the console:
    - system is a class from the core library provided by Java
    - out is an object that controls the output
    - println() is a method associated with that object that recieves a single argument. 
## main() method
    ``` Java 
    public class Person{
        public static void main(String[]args){
            System.out.println("Hello, world!);
        }
    }
    ```

    - in Java every application must contain a main() method
    - this is the entry point for the app
    - all other methods are invoked from the main() method.
    - the signature of the method is ***public static void main(String[]args){***
        - accepts a single argument - an array of elements of type string.
